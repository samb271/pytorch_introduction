# DATA: PREPARING AND LOADING

# Machine learning is a game of 2 parts:
#  1. Get data into a numerical representation
#  2. Build a model to learn patterns in that numerical representation

# Create some known data using the linear regression formula. We'll use a linear regression formula to make a straight line with known parameters

# Create known parameters where the weight is b and the bias is a (Y = aX + b)

weight = 0.7
bias = 0.3

# Let's create some data

start = 0
end = 1
step = 0.02
X = torch.arange(start, end, step).unsqueeze(dim=1)
y = weight * X + bias

# print("X tensor: ", X[:10])
# print("y values: ", y[:10])
# print("Length of X: ", len(X))
# print("Length of y: ", len(y))

# Now we know our inputs, X, and we know our outputs, y. We need to make a neural network that will predict the value of the parameters based on this information.

# Let's create a training and testing set with our data.

train_split = int(0.8 * len(X))

X_test, y_test = X[train_split:], y[train_split:]
